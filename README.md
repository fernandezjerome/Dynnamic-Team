# Dynamic Team Page
Changing Content on the Fly
#Assignment Description
Create a Team Bio page based on your partners for the Integrated Project. You’ll have some
standard team copy on the page initially (written by you); provide a way to click and change
content for each team member.
If you’re working alone, create a fake partner for this assignment.
This is a small team assignment with designer and developer roles.
# Assignment Requirements
Design a bio page! Consider this a page in the context of a larger studio site - look at how “real”
design / dev houses do this, and come up with your own style.
Only one team member’s information should be visible at a time; you’ll provide some way to
click and view each member’s information on demand.
Create an array to hold bio information (text) for each team member. Each team member is
responsible for populating this array with text - add your own! You’ll be retrieving this text on a
click or other event, and putting it into a paragraph tag (or multiple tags) on the page.
You will also include a headline for the team member’s name that will change based on
whose info is currently active.
Include an image tag that switches its source based on the team member you’re viewing
(head shot or something similar).
